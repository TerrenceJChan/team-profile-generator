## Installation
Walkthrough video can be seen here on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/CG4LqiW1tLE)  
Clone over repo from GitHub: https://github.com/TerrenceJChan/team-profile-generator  
Open the folder in the terminal, and make sure to install the app's necessary dependencies! To do this, enter `npm i`
## Usage
In the terminal, enter `node index.js` in the main directory. The first set of prompts assume that the user is the team manager.  
Once the first person's entry is submitted, the user is given the option to enter another team member or to generate the HTML file. If an addition member is created, the user will be asked what role they have in the team (engineer, intern, manager).  
Repeat as necessary, and then select the option to produce the HTML file. It can be found in the **dist** directory.
